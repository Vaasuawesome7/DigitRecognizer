# DigitRecognizer
Hey all! This is the Digit Recognizer app and we give you two options to get the output of your handwritten digit, one is through
by painting the digit on a whiteboard while the other allows you to take a picture. Since this is still in development, do keep in 
mind of the following instructions to get the best output

1) In Paint section, try writing the numbers very clearly and make sure that they are well confined and small in size (smaller 
than alloted space shown).

2) In Camera section, I recommend you to write the digit on a white blank sheet of paper, with the digit being written in a black pen.

Hope you enjoy the app and stay tuned for more updates ;)
